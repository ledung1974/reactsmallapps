                <strong>What is Lorem Ipsum?</strong>
                <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
                industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
                since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

                <strong>Where does it come from?</strong>
                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
                roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
                2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
                College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
                the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

                <strong>Why do we use it?</strong>
                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
                readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using
                Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
                as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                readable English.

                <strong>Where can I get some?</strong>
                There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
                majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
                randomised words which don't look even slightly believable
